## Overview

*Chroma* is a 2D puzzle platformer built around color-based mechanics, where player abilities and interactions depend on color states.

This folder contains **refactored gameplay-system excerpts** written by me for portfolio purposes.  
The original project was developed in a team academic repository and cannot be shared publicly in full.

These samples highlight my work on:

- Collision and physics logic  
- Color-based projectile interactions  
- Moving platform systems  
- ECS-based gameplay architecture contributions

## Files Included

### `predictive_aabb.cpp`
Demonstrates predictive AABB collision detection for dynamic objects.

Key ideas:
- Future-position collision checks  
- Simple collision resolution  
- Frame-independent logic  

---

### `projectile_hit_logic.cpp`
Shows projectile interaction logic tied to color states.

Key ideas:
- Color-based hit detection  
- Gameplay rule filtering  
- Modular projectile handling  

---

### `moving_platform.cpp`
Implements moving-platform behavior and player carry logic.

Key ideas:
- Delta-time platform movement  
- Player attachment handling  
- Reusable platform logic
