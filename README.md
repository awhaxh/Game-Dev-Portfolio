# Featured Projects

Selected academic team projects with publicly shareable gameplay-system excerpts.

## Purrsuit of Home  
C++ | Alpha Engine | Team of 5 | 13 weeks

Grid-based Crossy Road–style game about guiding a stray cat through hazards.

**My Contributions**
- Implemented a grid-based collision system for moving obstacles using frame-independent movement (dt)  
- Built life, scoring, and player-state systems  
- Designed modular obstacle looping with difficulty scaling  
- Integrated UI and audio systems and contributed to bug fixing and stability improvements

Repo: Original project is in a private academic repository.  
This portfolio includes refactored gameplay-system code samples demonstrating my contributions.

## Chroma  
C++ | Custom Engine | Team of 8 | 26 weeks

2D platformer featuring color-based puzzle mechanics.

**My Contributions**
- Expanded an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with custom gameplay components, including logic for moving platforms  
- Implemented a player-follow camera with viewport constraints  
- Programmed color-based projectile logic and collision handling  
- Developed save/load functionality and debugging tools
